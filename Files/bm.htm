				<li>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
				Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) 
				and "doubles" (with two players per side).</li>
				<li>Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; 
				formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and 
				landing it within the other team's half of the court.</li>
				<li>Peter Gabriel Magnaye de Jesus (born 9 April 1992) is a Filipino badminton player.
				He won the men's doubles title at the 2014 Swiss International tournament with Paul Jefferson Vivas, 
				and the mixed doubles title at the 2019 Sydney International with Thea Pomar.</li>
